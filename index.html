      <p>London is one of the largest and most densely populated cities in the world. It’s also a common stop on most backpacking trips, European vacations, or two-week holidays. Everyone wants to come to London! People are drawn to it by images of pubs, museums, theater, and royalty. London is a cultural and fashion capital, a great place to go out, and an amazing place to eat. I love visiting this city (though I wouldn’t live here). There’s always something new to do! The only problem with London is that it’s very, very expensive; it can eat away at your budget if you aren’t careful. Luckily, there are tons of free or cheap things to do in London that can fill your time. But just be sure to budget extra for this city — you’ll need it!
